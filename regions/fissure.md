# Fissure

## Trash Dump
The landing point for the [First Keep](regions/upper-fortress.md#first-keep)'s midden chute, now ruled by the trog Trash King.

## Pilgrim's Boardwalk
A precarious walkway around the cliff-face from the Fissure's mouth to the [Sun Elf Court](regions/upper-fortress.md#sun-elf-court).

## Trog Tunnels
The dense network of tunnels connecting the Fissure to the [Cthnoic Roots](regions/subterrain.md#cthonic-roots) and the [Near Temple](regions/subterrain.md#near-temple).

## Swampy Rivulet
The bit directly beneath e.g. the [Wizard's Bridge](regions/surrounds.md#wizard-bridge). Occupied by swamp guys.
