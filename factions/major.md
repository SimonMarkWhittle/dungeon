# Major Factions
Groups that are extensively present in or exert strong influence on the dungeon.

## Oleus and his Constructs
A brain-fungus-farming wizard who provides mind-backup services to powerful clients, who he fears will be irate that their backups are being eaten by the moon spiders he is at war with.

Located in the [Upper Courtyard](../regions/upper-fortress.md#upper-courtyard) and [Wizard's Seam](../regions/upper-fortress.md#wizards-seam)

### Oleus
A brain-fungus-farming wizard who provides mind-backup services to powerful clients, who he fears will be irate that their backups are being eaten by the moon spiders he is at war with.

This wizard has set up shop in [The Wizard's Seam](../regions/upper-fortress.md#wizards-seam), using the Brainfungus he invented to store copies of the minds of powerful clients so that they may be reborn. He specializes in creating customized spores to produce crops of Brainfungus that either emulate a client's mind, or a custom mind of his creation (e.g. wise philosophic advisor, service henchman, devoted lover, etc.). His Brainfungus crops have spilled out into the Upper Courtyard, attracting the attention of the Moon Spiders, who are ravenous for psychological matter, causing him to set up a patchwork of arcane defenses to protect his investments. Oleus, at this point, is dead, but he has a back-up Brainfungus clone ready to go - the party just needs to activate it. If multiple clones are created, they will bicker over which one is the real wizard. If alive and able, he will exact payment from the party for passing through his tower, and he will steal their shadows until they repay him. Lacking a shadow makes light magic weird and is bad. The crystal-light hanging in his office can bzaps you to a lower appeals court on the moon with a very bored court clerk.

## Zar-Amun and his Pilgrims
This organization is devoted to bringing about the apocalypse. Its leader, [Zar-Amun](#zar-amun) believes that cracking open the Firmament will lose the shining waters of Heaven that may douse all, the Earth, and even unto Hell, cleansing them of evil. Adherents to this cult gather in [Another Village](../regions/surrounds.md#another-village) and are led along the [Pilgrim's Boardwalk](../regions/fissure.md#pilgrims-boardwalk), a rickety walkway along the edge of the Fissure, up to the [Sun Elf Court](../regions/upper-fortress.md#sun-elf-court). There, they are branded with the [Sign of Amun](), which saps Light from the bearer's surroundings, fueling the cult's works.

### Zar-Amun
A charismatic man of faith who has accrued followers in his cult bent upon predicting and bringing about the apocalypse.

This sanguine cult leader wants to crack open the Firmament and douse Earth, Cthon, Limbo, and Hell itself in the shining waters that he believes shall pour forth out of heaven. To achieve the quenching of the fiery abyss and purgation of evil from the world forever, he requires both the piercing of the heavens and the clearing of the [First Sword]()'s tunnel through the sphere of Earth at a time when the Eye is upon its opposite side. To this end, he has been attempting to adapt the Sun Elfs' constructions within the [Sun Elf Court](../regions/upper-fortress.md#sun-elf-court), with the aid of devoted engineers, to become a massive drilling structure and potent celestial laser. It is a long way from completion, but, for its activation, the [Sun Regent's Regalia]() is a *clear* engineering requirement, and so he is engaged in warfare with [The Trash King](#the-trash-king) in order to claim it.


## Aurog and his Forces
A devil and the trogs he has bound to his will with diabolic runes.

## The Trash King's Court
Trogs and men ruled by the wizard trog called "The Trash King", who collects what falls from the Midden Chute.

## The Moon Spiders
Animalistic moon spiders, frenzied by the hellish light of the chthonic roots, where they dwell, and by the ready abundance of brain(-fungus) matter to eat.
