# Minor Factions
Groups that are present in or influence several regions of the dungeon.

## The Dragon Hunters
Adventurous monster slayers, seeking to kill [dragonname]() for reasons as diverse as their skillsets and backgrounds.

Their current plan is to ambush the drake after luring it to sleep in the dragon's den within the [Hall of Giants](../regions/lower-fortress.md#hall-of-giants). This idea hinges upon the use of an ancient Nephilim bow that they recovered from the [Giants' Tomb](../regions/subterrain.md#giants-tomb) to slay the dragon in its sleep. However, their plan is flawed in two respects: they are incorrect as to what causes the dragon to sleep, and they have misconstrued the bow as a weapon, when in fact it is an instrument of dragon husbandry if used to produce music.

They must blow the dragon's horn within the hall in order to summon the dragon.


## The Weaver's Handmaidens
Deeply ancient humans, bound to the Ancient Weaver and ensorcelled by [Pisilisk](), who wander the Fortress doing his bidding while leaving secret signs to request their rescue.

Their task, set by [Pisilisk](), is to retrieve [some artifact]() necessary for releasing the Midnight King. However, they are rebellious and balk against this mental domination, and desire, instead, to enter the idyllic world of their tapestries forever. Their entreaties for aid in their release must be subtle because they each bear embroidered upon their garments the image of [Pisilisk](), which is the agent of his oversight and mind control.

### The Ancient Weaver
One of the final Nephilim, she came to dwell in the castle as a guest of the Moon Elfs. She cannot die until she has completed her final tapestry, the work on which has stalled while [Pisilisk](), the great Moon Spider, unweaves all she weaves. Her chamber is filled with an immense mound of woven tapestry, which, upon the completion of her work, shall destroy the moon. She is weaving together the souls of her slain people into a mystical bolt of energy of immense destructive force.

### The Chief Chambermaid
In her aeons of life serving The Weaver, <> has spent her time passing into and out of the various worlds of the Tapestries, spending many long years both within them and without them. She seeks, now, to free herself from Pisilisk's ensorcellement and live out her years within a particular tapestry that she must charm into expanding into a full world. To this end, she has dedicated herself to the study of sorceries, reading exhaustively of her Lady's personal library, and coveting texts from the Scriptorium These she cannot retrieve herself due to her Lady's bond, but acquires at times from wanderers of the Fortress. All she requires now is [maybe some tome]() and(/or) [maybe some artifact]().


## Plakebus' Acolytes
A devil mage and the humans he has duped into serving him to find the "coolest" artifact in the Fortress so that he might break the Demon Gate.


## Crazed Oracles
Trog seers, allied with Aurog, who have beheld the Eye of Hell and now are wracked with visions so potent that their prophesies force themselves into reality.

### The High Oracle
An individual, both deaf and blind, who has such a strong memory of their potent, nightly visions of the subsequent day, that they are able to proceed as though they had all their senses. There is, however, one aspect of the world that is hidden from their sight. (somehow this is a buzzle)


## Rot-Ogres
The obsessive, tormented human residents of the Fortress during its conquest by the Moon Elfs, now turned to imperfectly immortal servants with rotting flesh.
